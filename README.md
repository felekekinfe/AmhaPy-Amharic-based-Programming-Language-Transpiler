## ‚ú® About AmhaPy

AmhaPy is an **open-source educational initiative** aimed at significantly easing the entry into programming for individuals who are native Amharic speakers. Learning programming often requires mastering English terminology and syntax, which can be a considerable hurdle. AmhaPy seeks to remove this initial barrier.

At its heart, AmhaPy is a **transpiler**. It takes source code written using familiar Amharic keywords and a clear, Python-inspired structure, and converts it directly into standard **Python 3** code. This allows learners to focus on the fundamental concepts of programming ‚Äì logic, control flow, data handling, and problem-solving ‚Äì using a language they understand, before needing to fully transition to English-based syntax.

**Status:** This project is a **Proof of Concept** and is currently in its early development phase. It supports a foundational set of programming constructs and demonstrates the viability of an Amharic-based syntax.

## üöÄ Features

*   **Intuitive Amharic Keywords:** Core programming instructions are represented by meaningful Amharic words.
*   **Pythonic Syntax:** Follows Python's emphasis on readability, utilizing significant indentation for code blocks.
*   **Essential Control Flow:** Includes support for conditional logic (`if`/`elif`/`else` - `·ä®·àÜ·äê`/`·ã´·àà·â†·àà·ãö·ã´_·ä®·àÜ·äê`/`·ã´·àà·â†·àà·ãö·ã´`) and looping (`for`/`while` - `·àà`/`·â†`, `·ä•·àµ·ä®·àÜ·äê`).
*   **Functions:** Define reusable code blocks (`def` - `·à•·à´`) and return values (`return` - `·àò·àò·àà·àµ`).
*   **Basic Data Handling:** Work with numbers, strings (text), and boolean values (`True`/`False` - `·ä•·ãç·äê·âµ`/`·àê·à∞·âµ`).
*   **Operators & Comparisons:** Use standard arithmetic operators and express comparisons (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`) using Amharic keywords.
*   **Amharic Identifiers:** Use Amharic characters (Geez script) for naming variables and functions, in addition to standard Latin letters and underscores.
*   **Readable Output:** Transpiles into clean and understandable Python 3 code.
*   **Simple Workflow:** Run your `.amha` source files directly using the main Python script.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Python 3.6 or a newer version** installed on your computer.

### Installation

AmhaPy is currently a single Python script, making installation straightforward:

1.  **Clone the repository:** Open your terminal or command prompt and execute:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/felekekinfe/AmhaPy-Amharic-based-Programming-Language-Transpiler.git
    cd AmhaPy-Amharic-based-Programming-Language-Transpiler
    ```

2.  That's all! You're now set up to write and run AmhaPy code.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

To write and run an AmhaPy program:

1.  **Write your code:** Use any plain text editor to write your AmhaPy code and save the file with the `.amha` extension (e.g., `my_first_script.amha`).
2.  **Execute the script:** Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository, and run the `amhapy_transpiler.py` script, providing the path to your `.amha` file:

    ```bash
    python amhapy_transpiler.py path/to/your/my_first_script.amha
    ```

The script will perform the following steps automatically:

1.  Reads the content of your `.amha` file.
2.  **Tokenizes** the code, identifying keywords, identifiers, operators, literals, and processing indentation.
3.  **Transpiles** the token stream into equivalent Python 3 code, mapping Amharic keywords and reconstructing indentation.
4.  **Prints** the generated Python code to your console.
5.  **Executes** the transpiled Python code using Python's built-in `exec()` function.
6.  **Displays** any output produced by your program.

## üìñ AmhaPy Language Reference

AmhaPy syntax is modeled closely after Python's, using significant indentation and a straightforward structure, but replacing keywords with Amharic terms.

### Keywords

Here are the essential keywords in AmhaPy and their Python equivalents:

### Indentation

AmhaPy, just like Python, uses **significant indentation** to define code blocks. After control flow statements or function definitions (`·ä®·àÜ·äê:`, `·ã´·àà·â†·àà·ãö·ã´:`, `·ã´·àà·â†·àà·ãö·ã´_·ä®·àÜ·äê:`, `·ä•·àµ·ä®·àÜ·äê:`, `·à•·à´:`), lines belonging to that block must be indented using a consistent number of spaces. The standard in AmhaPy (and Python) is **4 spaces** per indentation level. Mixing spaces and tabs, or using inconsistent indentation amounts, will result in errors.

```amhapy
·ä®·àÜ·äê ·ä•·ãç·äê·âµ: # Colon at the end starts a new block
    # This line is indented 4 spaces (one level)
    ·ä†·à≥·ã≠ "Inside the first block"
    ·ä®·àÜ·äê 5 ·âµ·àç·âÖ 3: # Nested block
        # This line is indented 8 spaces (two levels)
        ·ä†·à≥·ã≠ "Inside the nested block"
# This line is back at the base level (0 spaces)
·ä†·à≥·ã≠ "Outside blocks"
