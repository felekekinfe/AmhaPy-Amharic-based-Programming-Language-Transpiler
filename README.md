## ‚ú® About AmhaPy

AmhaPy is an **open-source educational project** designed with a clear mission: to make the world of programming more accessible and less intimidating for individuals whose primary language is Amharic.

It functions as a **transpiler**. This means it reads code written in AmhaPy (using Amharic keywords and a syntax inspired by Python) and automatically converts it into standard, executable **Python 3** code.

The primary benefit is enabling beginners to focus on understanding fundamental programming concepts, logic, and problem-solving using familiar linguistic tools, before needing to navigate the complexities of English-based syntax.

**Status:** AmhaPy is currently in its **early development stage (Proof of Concept)**. It supports core basic functionalities, laying the groundwork for future expansion.

## üöÄ Features

*   **Amharic-First Keywords:** Write your programs using intuitive Amharic terms for fundamental programming instructions and concepts.
*   **Pythonic Syntax:** Leverages Python's clean, readable structure, crucially including significant indentation for code blocks.
*   **Core Control Flow:** Implement decision making with `if`/`else` (`·ä®·àÜ·äê`/`·ã´·àà·â†·àà·ãö·ã´`) and loops with `for` (`·àà`/`·â†`) and `while` (`·ä•·àµ·ä®·àÜ·äê`).
*   **Functions:** Define and reuse your own blocks of code using `def` (`·àò·åç·àà·çÖ`) and return values with `return` (`·àò·àò·àà·àµ`).
*   **Basic Data Types:** Handle numbers, text (strings), and True/False values (booleans - `·ä•·ãç·äê·âµ`/`·àê·à∞·âµ`).
*   **Operators:** Use standard arithmetic, assignment, and comparison operators with Amharic keyword equivalents for comparisons.
*   **Amharic Identifiers:** Name your variables and functions using Amharic characters (Geez script) if you prefer!
*   **Clean Python Output:** The transpiled code is readable Python 3, making it easy to see the conversion.
*   **Simple Execution:** Run your `.amha` source files directly using the provided script.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need to have **Python 3.6 or newer** installed on your system.

### Installation

AmhaPy is currently a single-file script, so getting it running is quick and easy!

1.  **Clone the repository:** Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/felekekinfe/AmhaPy-Amharic-based-Programming-Language-Transpiler.git
    cd AmhaPy-Amharic-based-Programming-Language-Transpiler
    ```

2.  That's it! You now have the `amhapy_transpiler.py` script and can start coding.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

To run an AmhaPy program:

1.  Write your AmhaPy code in a plain text file and save it with a `.amha` file extension (e.g., `my_first_app.amha`).
2.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the directory where you cloned this repository.
4.  Execute the transpiler script, providing the path to your `.amha` file:

    ```bash
    python amhapy_transpiler.py path/to/your/my_first_app.amha
    ```

When you run this command, the script performs the following steps:

1.  Reads the content of your `.amha` file.
2.  Passes the code through its **tokenizer**, breaking it down into a sequence of meaningful tokens and processing indentation.
3.  Uses the **transpiler** logic to convert the Amharic tokens and structure into equivalent Python 3 code.
4.  **Prints** the generated Python code to the console, allowing you to see the result of the transpilation.
5.  **Executes** the transpiled Python code directly using Python's built-in `exec()`.
6.  **Displays** any output generated by your AmhaPy program's execution.

## üìñ AmhaPy Language Reference

AmhaPy's syntax is intentionally designed to be very similar to Python's, using indentation and familiar structures, but substituting English keywords with Amharic ones.

### Keywords

These are the reserved words in AmhaPy that have special meaning:

| AmhaPy Keyword        | Python Equivalent | Meaning (Amharic)         | Programming Concept         |

### Indentation

AmhaPy follows Python's rule of **significant indentation**. Code blocks (after `·ä®·àÜ·äê:`, `·ã´·àà·â†·àà·ãö·ã´:`, `·ä•·àµ·ä®·àÜ·äê:`, `·àò·åç·àà·çÖ:`) must be indented consistently. Use **4 spaces** for each level of indentation. Mixing spaces and tabs is not supported and will likely cause errors.

```amhapy
·ä®·àÜ·äê ·ä•·ãç·äê·âµ: # Start of a block
    # This line must be indented 4 spaces
    ·ä†·à≥·ã≠ "Inside the if block"
    ·ä®·àÜ·äê 5 ·âµ·àç·âÖ 3: # Start of a nested block
        # This line must be indented 8 spaces
        ·ä†·à≥·ã≠ "Inside the nested block"
# This line is outside the blocks, back at the base level (0 spaces)
·ä†·à≥·ã≠ "Outside blocks"
